Michael Keaton makes for a good almost-villain. (He wasn't THAT evil if we're being honest.) \r\n\r\n[spoiler] I was really disappointed that Logan Marshall-Green was barely there and then got killed. Especially since I was surprised and got REALLY excited when I saw him, even though I thought he was Tom Hardy at first. Ha! [/spoiler]",

    "comment": "What a disappointing movie. Sure it was quite enjoyable but to call it the best spiderman movie ever is an insult to those previous efforts. I understand that this spiderman is new and is not used to soaring the heights of New York City but something was missing. Tom Holland and Michael Keaton are both terrific actors, especially with Tom in that one scene in the warehouse, I could feel the pain the character was going through. But I felt as though lacked a lot of special moments, it didn't help that the score was very bland as are most marvel movies unfortunately. Nevertheless, I know the sequels will develop the spiderman character into the great one I know him to be. I'd still recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time. ",

    "comment": "I really enjoyed this movie. There are lots of complaints because of the mix up of races and the way it differs from the original but it really doesn't affect the plot at all. A bully is a bully whether they're white or brown. The main thing about this movie is that it's just really fun. Peter's character is awesome and I liked his enthusiasm. And in the nerdy best friend and he felt like a real, quirky person and a believable 15 year old. It was nonstop and it didn't feel slow at all. When there wasn't fighting there was humor and it really kept the movie moving really well. Overall, well done and super fun! ",
