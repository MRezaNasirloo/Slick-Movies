The syndicated series ran 52 episodes, while the Saturday morning run ran 13.\n\nThe series follows teenage Hercules training as a hero as well as trying to adjust to life. With his free-spirited friend Icarus, his future-seeing friend Cassandra and his teacher Philoctetes, he battles his evil uncle Hades. Like all teenagers though, Hercules has to worry about peer pressure when the snobbish prince Adonis ridicules him.

He maintains an awkward and often antagonistic demeanor with his guests, asking them bizarre and inappropriate questions mixed with offhand non-sequiturs. Episodes often include a segment in which Galifianakis awkwardly interrupts his guests to promote a sponsor's product--examples include bananas, Need for Speed: Shift videogame, and Speed Stick deodorant. The series' theme music is Dave Blume's arrangement of Bernard Herrmann's Theme from Taxi Driver, which is on the original Taxi Driver soundtrack album but was not included in the film.",

Even so, Windows 95 was Microsoft’s first major successful version of Windows, and laid the foundation for what all future versions of Windows would be even to this day. Windows 95 was the first to include the Start Menu and taskbar, two very important and much loved features used today. Those who were upgrading from Windows 3.11 will know that Windows 95 was a drastic change, but Microsoft was nice enough to provide an awesome video guide which taught users the basics of the new operating system. The walkthrough is an hour long, and hosted by none other than Jennifer Aniston and Mathew Perry from the hit sitcom TV show Friends! An hour of cringe-worthy, hilarious moments showcasing what we thought was amazing back in 1995",
